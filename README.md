Crayola color library for Sass

A color library built from the list of Crayola standard crayon colors on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors#Standard_colors).

The easiest way to include this in your project is to import it into your existing Sass as a partial:

```Sass
@import 'crayola';
```

## Install

### Bower

```Shell
bower install crayola
```

### Meteor

```Shell
meteor add mickm:crayola
```

**WARNING: Meteor package is currently broken. Expect a fix soon.**
